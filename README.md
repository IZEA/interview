# Interview

Interested in joining the [IZEA Engineering][izea] team? We believe that a great
way for you to show us who you are is with your code. Completing a project, in
addition to a physical interview, has many benefits:

- **You have code to share.** Maybe your current employer doesn't allow you to
  show us what you've been working on, or maybe you just finished school or a
  developer bootcamp and haven't established a portfolio. Now you have code to
  show us.

- **Express yourself.** Interviews can be stressful and people get nervous.
  Working on a project without the watchful eye of an interviewer gives you the
  chance to show us your best work.

- **Everyone works on the same project.** All job candidates work on the same
  set of projects. This allows us to look at everyone objectively based on
  their work.

## Getting Started

### 1. Pick a Project

Each type of technology that we use at IZEA has a representative folder within
this repository. The folder contains a `README.md` with a description of the
project we would like you to build.

We currently offer the following projects:

- [Ember.js](front_end)
- [iOS](ios)
- [Android](android)
- [Rails](rails)
- [Web Services](web_services)

### 2. Create a New Repository

Since we don't offer a starting point for any of the projects, create a new
repository on your GitHub account. It can be public or private.

### 3. Commit Often

At IZEA, we like to commit often. This helps document your thought process and
makes it much easier to revert a change that causes a bug.

### 4. Have Fun

This is your chance to express yourself. If you have knowledge of technologies
that you think will help with completing the project, use them. We love learning
just as much as you!

### 5. Apply

You can view open positions and apply [online][apply]. Don't forget to include
the link to your GitHub profile.

## Need Help?
