# Ember Project

We've put your soft skills to the test, now we want to see some dope code! For this part of the interview, we would like you to create a small Ember.js app that requests and shows data from the [Reqres API](https://reqres.in/). We would like for you to use ember-data to talk to this API, but if you're having trouble getting ember-data to work, you can use a simpler addon like [ember-ajax](https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-ajax).

If any special requirements have been conveyed to you from your interview
team, they supersede the following.

## Requirements

- [ ] Display a paginated list of users. The data should be retrieved from the [Reqres API](https://reqres.in/), and there should be pagination controls to retrieve additional pages of data.
- [ ] Each user should be able to toggle a side sliding panel/modal that is populated with that user's data. You can make this look & behave pretty much however you want, but it should not trigger a full route transition.
- [ ] Style it to the best of your ability using sass.
- [ ] Do not use a front end framework such as bootstrap.
